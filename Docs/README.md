appreadport.py  

The provided code is a Python script that creates a simple HTTP server using the http.server module. The server responds to GET requests by sending a plain text response containing a greeting message and some additional text.
    The MyHandler class inherits from http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler and overrides the do_GET method to customize the server's response.
    In the do_GET method, a response with a status code of 200 and the "Content-type" header set to "text/plain" is sent.
    The TRAINER_NAME environment variable is accessed using os.environ.get() with a default value of "Undefined" if the variable is not set.
    The PORT environment variable is also accessed using os.environ.get() with a default value of 48888 if the variable is not set.
    A response text is constructed with a greeting message that includes the value of the TRAINER_NAME environment variable and some additional text.
    The response text is encoded and sent as the response body using self.wfile.write().
    The run_server function creates a TCP server on the specified port using socketserver.TCPServer and the MyHandler class.
    The server is started by calling httpd.serve_forever().
    If the script is executed directly (i.e., not imported), the default port is obtained from the PORT environment variable (or set to 48888 if not defined), and the run_server function is called.
